* The Null & Alternative Hypothesis
** Definition:
Denoted by $H_0$, the /null hypothesis/ is the claim that is initially believed to be true. The /alternative hypothsis/, denoted by $H_a$, is the assertion that is contradictory to $H_0$

In a problem the null hypothesis will be rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis only if sample evidence suggests that $H_0$ is false.
