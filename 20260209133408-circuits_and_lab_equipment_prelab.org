* Questions
1. ~For resistors with the following colors bands give the resistance and tolerances:~
   a. ~Brown, Black, Red, Silver =~
      + *Resistance:* 1,000  ohms
      + *Tolerance:* +-10%
   b. ~Blue, Gray, Black, None~
      + *Resistance:* 68 ohms
      + *Tolerance:* +-20%
   c. ~Green, Blue, Orange, Gold =~
      + *Resistance:* 56,000 ohms
      + *Tolerance:* +-5%
   d. ~Brown, Black Blue, None =~
      + *Resistance:* 10,000,000 ohms
      + *Tolerance:* +-20%

3. ~Determine the maximum voltage that a 470 \[\Omega\], 1/4 W Resistor can have across it without exceeding its power rating.~
   + \[I = \sqrt(P*R)\]  = \[\sqrt(0.25W*470 \Omega)\] = \[\sqrt(117.5)\] = 10.84V
