* Questions
1. ~For resistors with the following colors bands give the resistance and tolerances:~
   a. ~Brown, Black, Red, Silver =~
      + *Resistance:* 1,000  ohms
      + *Tolerance:* +-10%
   b. ~Blue, Gray, Black, None~
      + *Resistance:* 68 ohms
      + *Tolerance:* +-20%
   c. ~Green, Blue, Orange, Gold =~
      + *Resistance:* 56,000 ohms
      + *Tolerance:* +-5%
   d. ~Brown, Black Blue, None =~
      + *Resistance:* 10,000,000 ohms
      + *Tolerance:* +-20%
2. ~Determine the maximum current that a 470 Ohm, 1/4 W Resistor can have across it without exceeding its power rating.~
   \[I = \sqrt(P/R)\]  \[=\sqrt(0.25W/470 \Omega)\]  \[=\sqrt(0.0005319)\] \[=23mA\]
3. ~Determine the maximum voltage that a 470 Ohm, 1/4 W Resistor can have across it without exceeding its power rating.~
    \[V = \sqrt(P*R)\]  \[=\sqrt(0.25W*470 \Omega)\] \[=\sqrt(117.5)\] \[=10.84V\]
4. ~Find the missing value using Ohm's Law with the values below:~
   a. *Current = 3A, Resistance = 10 Ohms, Voltage* = 3 * 10 = 30V
   b. *Voltage  = 12V, Resistance = 10 Ohms, Current* = 12/4 = 3A
   c. *Voltage = 120V, Current = 0.5A, Resistance* = 120/0.4 = 240 Ohms
