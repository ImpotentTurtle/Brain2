* Using the Digital Multimeter (DMM)
+ 1kOhm Resistor
  + *Measured:* 0.9876 kOhm
+ 470 Ohm Resistor
  + *Measured:* 464.230 Ohms
+ 220 Resistor
  + *Measured*: 217.774 Ohms

* Simple Bread Boarding, Calculating and Reading Voltage, Current, and Power


1. \[3V = I * 220\Omega\]  \[-> 3V / 220\Ohms = I = 13.63636364 mA\]

2. \[3V * 13.6364mA = P = 0.04091 W\]

   + Yes, the resistor will be able to handle the power in the circuit as it falls well below 0.25 W
