* Notes:
|GOAL:
*Create an application that will track the user's nutritional intake for the day*

|Process:
+ Output -> vector/array of food choices
  + food choices will have fixed nutritional values....
+ Continuous - iterative loop compounding each choice until the user exits


+ Will need main and food item class
  + Will need to overwrite the addition operator "+" so we can add food items together
