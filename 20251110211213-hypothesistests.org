* The Null & Alternative Hypothesis
** Definition:
Denoted by $H_0$, the /null hypothesis/ is the claim that is initially believed to be true. The /alternative hypothsis/, denoted by $H_a$, is the assertion that is contradictory to $H_0$

+ A method using sample data to decide whether the null hypothesis test should be rejected or not is called a *test of hypothesis*

+ In a test of hypothesis the null hypothesis will be rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis only if sample evidence suggests that $H_0$ is false.

** Example:
Say, the null hypothesis is $H_0$: \Theta = \Theta_0. The alternative will look like one of the below:
1. $H_a$: \Theta > \Theta_0
2. $H_a$: \Theta < \Theta_0
3. $H_a$: \Theta != \Theta_0

* Test Procedures and P_Values
** Definition:
A rule, based on sample data, for deciding whether $H_0$ should be rejected.
+ Issue: If $H_0$ is true --> how likely is it that a random sample contradictory to the null would result. Consider
