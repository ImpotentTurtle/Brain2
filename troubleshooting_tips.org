Q: I have sent a print job, however I do not see it in queue for release?
+ First -- Confirm you are connected to the "Brookstone" WiFi -> *Attempt to reprint if connected to a different network*
+ Then -- Open the settings application on your laptop; search for the devices and printers menu; click on the printer you sent the file too and open up the queue page:
  + If you see your file here and a message that the queue/file is paused; right click on the document and click "unpause queue" -> *Check if your document has made it to the printer*

+ Last -- If you bring your mouse to the bottom right of the screen near the date and time; look for a button that looks like this " ^ "; click on it; here find the green printer icon (PaperCut) and click on "View Printers".
  + If you are prompted with a *login screen* then login with your @brookstoneschools.org credentials; go to "install printers" on the side of the screen and install the printers you need to use -> *Attempt to reprint*
