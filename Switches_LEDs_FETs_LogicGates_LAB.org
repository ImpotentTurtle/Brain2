* Switches and FETs

* Switch Logic
A. Power supply in series with two switches in series 1kOhm resistor and an LED on a breadboard
   4. Record the state of the LED for each switch combination
      a. --
B. Re-wire so that switches are now in parallel but still in series with the rest of the circuit
   9. Record the state of the LED for each switch state
      a. --
C. Connect circuit with a 1kOhm resistor in series, and place a switch and LED in parallel with each other
   14. Record the state of the LED for each switch state
      a. --
