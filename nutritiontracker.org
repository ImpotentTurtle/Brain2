* Notes:
|GOAL:
*Create an application that will track the user's nutritional intake for the day*

|Process:
+ Output -> vector/array of food choices
  + food choices will have fixed nutritional values....
+ Continuous - iterative loop compounding each choice until the user exits


+ Will need main and food item class
  + Food item classs will act like the "Nutrition Facts" section traditionally found on most food items today.
  + main will house our iterative loop alongside our string outputs
+ Addition operator "+" will need to be overwritten to enable us to add our food together easily.
