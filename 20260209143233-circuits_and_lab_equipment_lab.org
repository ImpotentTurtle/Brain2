* Using the Digital Multimeter (DMM)
+ 1kOhm Resistor
  + *Measured:* 0.9876 kOhm
+ 470 Ohm Resistor
  + *Measured:* 464.230 Ohms
+ 220 Resistor
  + *Measured*: 217.774 Ohms

* Simple Bread Boarding, Calculating and Reading Voltage, Current, and Power


3. \[3V = I * 220\Omega\]  \[-> 3V / 220\Ohms = I = 13.63636364 mA\]

4. \[3V * 13.6364mA = P = 0.04091 W\]

   + Yes, the resistor will be able to handle the power in the circuit as it falls well below 0.25 W
19. Values swapped between -2.8 and +2.8

* Series, Parallel, and Combination Series and parallel Circuits
2. Total Resistance: \[220 + 470 = 690\Omega\]
   + Total Resistance with 1kOhm resistor:  \[220+470+1000 = 1690\Omega\]
3. Total Current: \[V = I * R_T, I = 3V/690\Omega = .0043478 A\]
5. Readings
   + 220 Ohm:
     + V = 0.948 V
   + 470 Ohm
     + V = 2.024 V
   + I: + to 220 Ohm = 0.001A
   + I:  220 to 470 Ohm = 0.002A
   + I: 470 to - = 0.001A
