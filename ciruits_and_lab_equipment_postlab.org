* Questions
1. ~Discuss how you measured the voltage, amperes, and resistance. Where did you take the measurement and why?~
   a. Using the different settings on the given digital multimeter I determined the voltage, current, and resistance by using
2. ~Perform a percentage error calculation for the resistors measured in the lab and the predicted color code values in the pre-lab. Why are these values, predicted and measured, different?~

3. ~Perform a percentage error calculation for the currents and voltages measured in the lab and the calculated values in the lab. Why are these values, calculated and measured, different?~

4. ~How was the temperature of the resistor affected during the experiment?~
