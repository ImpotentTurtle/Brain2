#+title: MyWebsite
#+filetags:Projects

* Overview
~The main goal of this project is to create a personal website for myself. Similarly to those I look up to in the digital space, it would serve multiple functions (about me, projects/life updates, "rants" about my interests and the tools I use, etc.). It should a decent bit, while still being an enjoyable website to visit; Its got to have spunk (i.e. personal platform and portfolio)~
* Implementation && Inspiration
** Brainstorm
+ Portfolio page
  * I know that I definitiely want to include a section with some of my school projects (i.e. final interactive game project for computer engineering programming II)
  * I definitely want to have some of my personal projects as well.
  * These could mainly serve as showcases *Look into what digital portfolios typically look like*
+ About me page?
  * This could be a main page of sorts detailing who I am, my interests, my adventures with Julie, etc.
+ "Blog" section. This would be some sort of area where I just talk about my interests and the tools I am using. *look into some inspiration from those you look up to*
+ Landing Page
  * boot up screen in to the the landing page????
  * maybe this is where the basic about me/description of what the purpose of the page is.
  * design with some cool stuff like intersting plugins on the sides of the pages (pls consider mobile users)
  * light and dark mode (ew lowkey)
  * ambient sound (relaxing shit; waterfall, rain, beach, nature, etc.)
