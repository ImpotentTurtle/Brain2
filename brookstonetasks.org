* Notes
- Acuff may already have a hanging organizer (headphones), ask to confirm. It is a requirement to have.
- Check if Michelle Baldwin still has macbook (ex-griffin) in office.
- Will likely need to give Lauren Lawrences' old laptop to new teacher by end of week (11-21-2025)
- It'd probably be wise to look over each Smartboard in all classrooms to make sure they are up to date with the inventory list. This way we can order proper replacement pens.
