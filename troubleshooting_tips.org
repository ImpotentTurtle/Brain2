Q: ~My iPad seems to be frozen | I cannot interact with the screen~

  * Volume up, Volume down, then Hold down the power button until the screen shuts off completely.

+ Once this is done, your iPad should function as intended. If not, please reach out to IT

Q: ~How my students print with their chromebooks~
+ All Chromebooks are currently set up with our print server (PaperCut), so printing should be a relatively painless process for students!
  * Just as you would with your teacher laptops, selecting print on a document (or pressing ctrl + p) will open a window to select which printer you would like to send a job to.
  * Select your printer and follow the instructions listed on the screen; Once completed, retrieve the document from the printer!
