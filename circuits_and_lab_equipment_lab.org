3. \[3V = I * 220\Omega\]  \[-> 3V / 220\Ohms = I = 13.63636364 mA\]

4. \[3V * 13.6364mA = P = 0.04091 W\]

   + Yes, the resistor will be able to handle the power in the circuit as it falls well below 0.25 W

2. Total Resistance: \[220 + 470 = 690\Omega\]
   + Total Resistance with 1kOhm resistor:  \[220+470+1000 = 1690\Omega\]
3. Total Current: \[V = I * R_T, I = 3V/690\Omega = .0043478 A\]
5. Readings
   + 220 Ohm:
     + V = 0.948 V
   + 470 Ohm
     + V = 2.024 V
   + I: + to 220 Ohm = 0.001A
   + I:  220 to 470 Ohm = 0.002A
   + I: 470 to - = 0.001A
   + The pattern that I notice is that both the total Voltage and the Total Current are a result of the sum of currents and voltages across the circuit. Also yes, the 470Ohm resistor seems to have a higher voltage, I would assume this is because the 220Ohm was not able to resist as much current flowing through the circuit.
8. Current through (470 and 1kOhm)
    \[I = 3V/470\Omega = 0.00638298 A\]
    \[I  = 3V/1000\Omega = 0.003 A\]
9. Total Resistance with 220/470/1kOhm in parallel
   \[R_T = (1/220 + 1/470 + 1/1000)^-1 = 130.325\Omega\]
   \[I_T = (0.006 + 0.003 + 0.014) = 0.023A\]
   \[P_T = 3V * 0.023A = 0.069W\]
11. Voltage and Current Across Resistors
    + 470 Ohm
      + V = 2.96V
      + I = 0.006
    + 1kOhm
      + V = 2.9V
      + I = 0.004
    + The Resistor receiving more current is the 470 Ohm resistor as it does not resist as much current

15. Resistance and Total Current 220 series with
    \[R_T = 220 + (1/470 + 1/1000)^-1 = 539.728\Omega\]
    \[I_T = 3/220 = 0.014A\]
    \[P_T = 3V * 0.014A = 0.042W\]
16.

18.
    220 = 1.216 V and 0.01 A
    470 = 1.76 V and 0.06
    1000 = 1.76 V and  0.05
