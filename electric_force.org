** Electric Charge
*** Positive - Type 1 (Protons)
*** Negative - Type 2 (Electrons)
*** Behavior
 + Two charges of the same kind *repel*; two opposite charges *attract*
 + *Neutral* objects are attracted to a charge of either sign.
 + Charges can be transferred from one object to another - *Charging*
 + Charge is conserved
*** Conductors
Materials through which charge moves *easily*
*** Insulators
Materials on or in which charge is immobile
** Coulomb's Law
Coulomb’s law is the fundamental law for the electric force between two charged particles. Coulomb’s law, like Newton’s law of gravity, is an *inverse-square law*: The electric force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between charges.

** If two charged particles having q1 and q2 are a distance r apart, the particles exert forces on each other of magnitude
