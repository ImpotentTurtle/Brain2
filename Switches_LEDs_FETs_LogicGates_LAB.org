* Switches and FETs
A. Switch in series with 1kOhm resistor and an LED
   8. Results of this section
      + The LED light turns off once we remove the V+ from pin 2
* Switch Logic
A. Power supply in series with two switches in series 1kOhm resistor and an LED on a breadboard
   4. Record the state of the LED for each switch combination
      ~This represents an AND gate~
        | Switch1 | Switch2 | OutPut |
        |       0 |       0 |      0 |
        |       1 |       0 |      0 |
        |       0 |       1 |      0 |
        |       1 |       1 |      1 |
B. Re-wire so that switches are now in parallel but still in series with the rest of the circuit
   9. Record the state of the LED for each switch state
      ~This represents an OR gate~
        | Switch1 | Switch2 | Output |
        |       0 |       0 |      0 |
        |       1 |       0 |      1 |
        |       0 |       1 |      1 |
        |       1 |       1 |      1 |
C. Connect circuit with a 1kOhm resistor in series, and place a switch and LED in parallel with each other
   14. Record the state of the LED for each switch state
       ~This represents a NOT gate~
        | Switch | Output |
        |      1 |      0 |
        |      0 |      1 |
* Transistor Level Logic Gates
A. 1kOhm resistor and two FETs in series
   10. Record the state of the LED for each combination of FET inputs.
       ~This represents the behavior of an AND gate~
        | Transistor1 | Transistor2 | OutPut |
        |           0 |           0 |      0 |
        |           1 |           0 |      0 |
        |           0 |           1 |      0 |
        |           1 |           1 |      1 |
B. 1kOhm resistor and two FETs in parallel
   19. Record the state of the LED for ach combbination of FET inputs
       ~This represents the behavior of an OR gate~
        | Transistor1 | Transistor2 | OutPut |
        |           0 |           0 |      0 |
        |           1 |           0 |      1 |
        |           0 |           1 |      1 |
        |           1 |           1 |      1 |
